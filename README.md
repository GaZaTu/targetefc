# TargetEFC

Utility to track / target the enemy flag carrier in Warsong Gulch

This addon adds a little frame during Warsong Gulch games which shows the enemy flag carriers name

Every time you drop out of combat, a macro called `EFC!` will be created or updated with `/target <name of enemy flag carrier>` as it's code.

I was bored. I didn't find anything that satisfied me. Useful for quick mind vision i guess.
