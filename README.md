# TargetEFC

Utility to track / target the enemy flag carrier in Warsong Gulch

## What does it do?

This addon adds a little frame during Warsong Gulch games which shows the enemy flag carriers name

Every time you drop out of combat, a macro called `EFC!` will be updated with `/target <name of enemy flag carrier>` as it's code.
The frame will have a red background color if the macro is out of sync.

## Why tho?

I was bored. I didn't find anything that satisfied me. Useful for quick mind vision i guess.

## What's it look like?
